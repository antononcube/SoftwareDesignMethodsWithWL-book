# Software Design Methods with Wolfram Language

Chapters, code, and organizational materials for the book "Software Design Methods with Wolfram Language".

## In brief

The goal of this book is to introduce several methodologies for software design with Wolfram Language (WL).

WL is a general, multi-paradigm programming language. WL is mostly a functional programming language, but 
it also can be used in an procedural and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) manner. 
Of course, since WL is functional can be also used for the creation of Domain Specific Languages (DSL's). 

This book gives concrete directions how to do OOP, Monadic Programming, and DSL designs with WL. 
Concrete examples are presented and discussed.
